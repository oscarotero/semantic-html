# Abbreviation and acronyms

Provide an expansion of the abbreviation/acronym, neuronym even, in plain text
on first use, use an <abbr> to mark up the abbreviation, which provides a hint
to user agents on how to announce/display the content

```html
<p>
    <abbr>FWIW</abbr> (For what it's worth) I often get the following confused: <abbr>WTF</abbr> and <abbr>FTW</abbr>.
</p>

<p>
    By providing a plain text expansion besides the acronyms, myself and probably others, are less confused by the jargon. Thus improving usability and <abbr>a11y</abbr> (accessibility).
</p>
```
